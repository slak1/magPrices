We have goods in the store with a price between 0.01 and 100. Find all three prices whose sum is equal to their product. This corresponds to the story that a customer comes to the store, chooses three products and goes to the cash register. But the cashier, instead of adding prices, simply multiplies them. A surprised customer says, after all, prices should be added together. For this the seller OK I will add them, but the bill remains the same, OK, so how many such possible bills are there with three prices out of 10,000 products each with a different price from 0.01 to 100 (somecoins) whose sum of prices is equal to the product of prices?
There are 250,000,000,000 possible combinations to check and the program finds them in 30 seconds.
As a result of the number of bills there is a small mistake who will say what it is?
